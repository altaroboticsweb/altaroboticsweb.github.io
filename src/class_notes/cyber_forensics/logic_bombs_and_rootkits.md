Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 2.4.6
___
### Logic Bombs  
- A piece of code that waits for a particular set of conditions to be met, referred to as triggers  
- Triggers could be  
	- Number of transactions  
	- Certain system events  
	- User interaction  
	- Date/time (Referred to as a Time Bomb in this case)  
- Once triggered, the program executes  
- Often these are installed by an insider threat, such as a disgruntled employee and are setup before leaving and triggered by their removal in the system.

### Roger’s Logic Bomb  
- In 2002, Roger Duronio successfully deployed a logic bomb against his now former employer, UBS Wealth Management, over a disagreement in his annual bonus leading to two thousand servers crashing and nearly 400 offices being hit.  
- An estimated $3.1 million in damages was done and Roger got a new 9x9 home for 8 years as he served his time for computer fraud

### Defending Against a Logic Bomb  
- Due to their nature, logic bombs are incredibly difficult to identify and are not even active until the triggers have been met.  
- Using strong anti-virus software, keeping systems updated, and monitoring system tasks can assist with catching a malicious script or program hidden away.  
- Regular backups are crucial for restoring anything lost and in the case of Roger, helped by providing the logs of him accessing the system and setting up the logic bomb.

### Rootkits  
- Gives the user “root” access  
	- root = admin account on Linux/UNIX  
	- kit = the necessary software components that implement the tool  
- Alters system files  
	- Done to hide evidence of its existence  
	- Firmware rootkits rewrite part of the BIOS to start before the OS  
	- Bootkits replace a system’s bootloader for the same purpose  
	- Kernel rootkits replace some of the OS kernel to start at the same time as the OS  
	- Driver rootkits pretend to be a trusted driver the OS communicates with – drive shimming

### A Rootkit for Everyone  
- <u>NTRootkits</u>  
	- One of the first rootkits to target the Windows Operating System  
- <u>Machiavelli</u>  
	- The first rootkit to target Mac OS X, found in 2009  
- <u>Stuxnet</u>  
	- First known rootkit for industrial control systems (ICS)

### More on Stuxnet  
- One of the most famous rootkits, found in 2010  
- Contains three parts:  
	- A worm that executes all routines related to the main payload of the attack  
	- A link file that automatically executes propagated copies of the worm  
	- A rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes to prevent detection.  
- Targets supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems  
	- Is believed responsible for damage to Iran’s nuclear program

### Defense Against Rootkits  
- Keep your system current with:  
	- The latest patches (software updates) against known vulnerabilities  
	- Application updates  
	- Security software updates  
- If available, enable Secure Boot  
	- Detects tampering with bootloaders, key operating files, and unauthorized changes in firmware by validating digital signatures.
