Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 4.2

### Ransomware  
- Malware that encrypts, or locks, a victim’s access to files and/or the system and demands a ransom to regain access  
- Often, the demand is met with an ultimatum of the ransom increasing and/ or the data being deleted after a certain period.  
- Attackers use ransomware to target data that is valuable  
- Personal data such as finances, photos, and documents  
- Corporate data such as company financials, proprietary or trade secrets, customer data

### Types of Ransomware  
- Cryptomalware encrypts files, folders, or hard drives but the operating system itself may still be available.
	- Cryptomalware can also mean ransomware that asks for cryptocurrency for payment.  
- Lockers or locker-ransomware can lock a user out of their device completely, preventing them from accessing anything on the device.  
- Scareware alerts a user of an issue and demands payment to fix it. This threat is often accompanied by pop-ups and other issues on the device  
- Doxware, exortionware, or leakware threatens to release the stolen data if the ransom is not paid. 
	- Often used against public officials and celebrities with threats to release private or sensitive information

### To Pay or Not to Pay?  
- Ransomware is profitable for malicious actors simply because so many people pay the ransom to recover their files, which may or may not be returned in either case.  
- Preventing an attack from occurring or eliminating the need to pay for the return of the data is the best defense.  
- This can be done with:  
	- Training on potential threats  
	- Backing up data, preferably offsite or cloud-based  
	- Keeping systems and backups updated so there is little to no loss between the attack and recovery
