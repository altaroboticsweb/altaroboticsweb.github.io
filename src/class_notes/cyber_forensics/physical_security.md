# Physical Security
Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 1.2.3
___
### Physical Security Controls
- Bollards
- Access Control Vestibule
- Fences and Signs
- Video Surveillance
- Security Guard
- Access Badge
- Lighting
- Sensors

### Bollards
- Restricts access to a particular area
- Channels people through a specific point but prohibits cars or trucks.
- Other examples include moats, concrete barriers, and gravel pits.

### Access Control Vestibule
- Helps to enforce a “one scan, one entry guideline” for access to a restricted area.
- Small space with two sets of interlocking doors installed in a way that the one set of doors must be closed before the other set can open.
- Also known as sally port, air lock, or mantrap

### Fences and Signs
- A fence is a barrier, railing, or other upright structure that clearly defines the perimeter of the area.
- Signs can deter some people, but for other malicious users, they can be a case of “x marks the spot”.

### Video Surveillance
- Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is video surveillance you can use to see what is happening within your facility.
- Ensure to use camera with the right properties including focal length, field depth, and lighting requirements.

### Security Guard
- Allow or disallow people through a security checkpoint.
- Robot sentries
- Receptionists
- Two-person integrity

### Access Badge
- Logs movement through a central security system.
- Correlates logs between the physical world and digital world

### Lighting
- Proper internal and external lighting are critical elements of physical security.
- Dimly lit areas make it easier for intruders to easily execute illicit operations.

### Sensors
- Infrared
	- Motion detection and night vision camera and can alert for possible movement within a given area.
- Pressure
	- Can detect pressure near a door or atmospheric pressure in a room.
- Microwave
	- Can automatically turn on lights in a room due to motion but also set off alarms from motion.
- Ultrasonic
	- Can be used for proximity and distance.
