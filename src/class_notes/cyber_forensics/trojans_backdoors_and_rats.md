Cybersecurity Forensics Lesson 2.4.3
___
### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Trojans</span>  
- Software that is downloaded, installed, and seems harmless but does have a malicious intent  
- Reference to the Greek story of the siege of Troy  
- Unlike typical viruses, trojans cannot self- replicate nor propagate without user interaction  
- In most cases a user falls victim to a social engineering scheme and downloads the software thinking it is a harmless attachment or something they need or want.

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Backdoors</span>  
- The ability to access a system or data by bypassing the security controls  
- Avoids the normal login process  
- Can occur through various means:
	- Malware might install a backdoor to get back into the system  
	- Software may contain accidental backdoors meant originally to perform maintenance  
	- There could be an exploit that allow an intruder to gain access through a backdoor

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Remote Access Trojans (RAT) </span> 
- A type of trojan that combines the use of a backdoor allowing a malicious actor to have administrative and remote control of the host  
- Allows a hacker to connect remotely and examine files, log keystrokes, find passwords, take screenshots, or use the connection to download additional malware

### Other Forms of Trojans  
- Downloader Trojans can imitate pre-existing software that may need an update or serve to update pre-existing malware already installed on the device.  
- DDoS Trojans infect a victim's computers then perform DDoS attacks in hopes of disrupting network services  
- SMS Trojans can infect mobile devices and send and intercept messages

### Trojan Defense  
- Never download or run unknown or untrusted software  
- Verify signatures or hashes from developers prior to installing software  
- Keep anti-virus software updated  
- Back-up important files in the event a trojan is installed  
- Be mindful of opening attachments, even from known senders
