Cybersecurity Linux Lesson 1.2.2
___
### File Compressing and Archiving  
• Compressing and archiving are fundamental processes for Linux users  
• Optimize disk space utilization  
	• Size of data is reduced allowing for efficient storage and faster transmission  
• Ensure safety and integrity of data  
	• Safeguard against loss or deletion  
	• Allow restoration in the event of a hardware failure or malicious attack

### System Images  
• Clones of the operating system and configuration  
• Do not recover directories or files but allow a fast bootup for a system

### Backup and Backup Types  
Backups, occasionally referred to as archives, aid in restoring data that has been compromised

<u>Full Backup:</u>
	• Copies everything on the system  
	• Useful for recovering corrupted or lost files  
	• Very time consuming  
	• Takes up a ton of space

<u>Incremental Backup:  </u>
	• Copies everything on the system only if it has been modified  
	since the last backup by cross checking timestamps  
	• Takes less time that a full backup  
	• Each backup takes up less storage  
	• Recovery can be very time consuming due to having multiple  
	components to pull from

<u>Differential Backup:</u>
	• Like an incremental backup in that it only backs up what has been modified but differs in that it goes by the timestamp of the most recent full backup  
	• Occurs less often that an incremental backup  
	• Stronger chance that data could be lost

### Snapshots  
• Creates a full backup that is read-only  
• Takes a “snapshot” of the directory and files’ metadata and how things are stored  
• The read-only aspect makes the snapshot much faster than traditional backups  
• Snapshots of the metadata can occur multiple times a day

### Archiving  
• Like backups in that a copy is typically made  
• Usually limited in size or specific to a set of data  
• Often used with sensitive data, or data that must be kept for long periods of time such as financials but may not need accessing on a regular basis

### Archiving – cpio Utility  
• Stands for copy in and out  
• Can be run within a directory to archive those specific files  
• `cpio` maintains the directory’s references and outputs the data plus the files and directories contained into one archive file

### Archiving – tar Archiver  
• Stands for tape archiver  
• Similar to `cpio` but has the option to compress the files as well  
• Uncompressed data is referred to as a tar archive file  
• Compressed data is referred to as a tarball

### File Compression – gzip, bzip2, and xz  
• All of the utilities compress files using the zip and unzip mechanism  
• The commands are the name of the utility with the file name as seen with `gzip file1`
• `bzip` compresses files more than `gzip` but takes longer  
• `xz` can compress at a higher rate but also offers options to change the rate

### Backing Up Entire Drives with dd  
• The `dd` utility allows a user to copy the contents of a disk or partition onto a new drive or partition  
• Requires some additional steps such as ensuring the drive(s) being copied and the one(s) being copied to are not mounted, which may involve booting from an external source

| Tool | Common Uses | Pros | Cons | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gzip | Compressing single files | Fast and simple | Lower compression ratio  |
| bzip2 | Compressing larger files | Higher compression | Slower speed  |
| xz | Highest compression | Maximum compression for large files  | Even slower, requires more memory  |
| zip | Cross-platform compression  | User-friendly, works across different operating systems | Less efficient compression  |
| tar | Archiving multiple files and directories | Easy management | Needs additional tools for compression | 
| cpio | Archiving with directory maintenance | Versatile for backups | More complex to use |
| dd | Disk cloning and imaging | Accurate cloning of disk partitions  | Risky: Requires careful handling |
