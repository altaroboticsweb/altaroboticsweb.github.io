## Vocab:
###### Multicast:
IPv6 protocol, a group can receive the packets but, in the end, only one device receives.
###### Unicast:
IPv4 and IPv6 protocol, sends the packets to one specific device.
###### Anycast:
IPv4 protocol, all the packets go to every device on the network.
###### Broadcast:
IPv4 and IPv6 protocol, sends the packets to a group of specific devices.
#cybersecurity/cast

###### Loopback addresses
What is the loopback address for IPv4 and IPv6, what does it allow a machine to do?

127.0.0.1 and 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1; it allows a machine to send packets to itself for diagnostic purposes
#cybersecurity/loopback


Tunneling: Sending messages to an IPv6 network to all the nodes on the network.

Dual Stack: Allows devices to process IPv4 and IPv6 traffic simultaneously.

Shorthand notation: Allows for two networks/devices that use IPv6 to communicate over a network using IPv4.

Router advertisement: Uses the MAC address to create unique IP addresses that should not be used by other devices.

Stateless Address Auto-configuration: Allows an IPv6 address to be shortened since they can be very long to write out.

What is the purpose of a Domain Name System (DNS)?

The DNS, or Domain Name System, is the service that translates IP addresses to domain names.

How does DNS benefit end-users accessing websites?

Instead of users having to remember and type in the exact IP address of a web server, DNS converts it to a name so that a user can simply type in the URL; www.google.comis a lot easier to remember than 142.251.32.164.



### Clocks:
###### What is NTP?
Network Time Protocol has the important job of making sure all the clocks on the same network are synchronized.

Warm Site: Not an exact replica, but also not an empty building

Cold Site: An empty building

What’s the difference between an active-active and an active-passive configuration?

An active-active configuration has every server active so the load balancer can spread across all servers.

An active-passive configuration only has some servers active, and the load balancer spreads across those active servers.

What is the VRRP?

The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol is a computer networking protocol that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol routers to participating hosts.

- ###### UTP:
	Unshielded Twisted Pair: Does not have protection, but is usually cheaper
#### Fiber-optic Cables:
Use optical fibers that carry light over far distances at light-speed, used for long-distance telecommunications and high-speed data in buildings
- ###### Single-mode:
	Carries only one type of light-wave to transfer data (between 1310 nm - 1550 nm)
- ###### Multimode:
	Carries multiple different light waves (red, green, and blue) to send more compact data

**What is an advantage of using fiber-optic cables over twisted-pair Ethernet cables?**
Fiber-optic cables transmit data at a higher speed, over a longer distance.

**What is a drawback of using fiber-optic cables over twisted-pair Ethernet cables?**

Why is it important to update patches and firmware as soon as reasonably possible? Updating patches and firmware is important to protect devices against potential malicious attackers because some patch and firmware updates are there to fix security vulnerabilities.

When updating device drivers and firmware, if the device is not operating as it previously was or as it should, as a network administrator what should you do? Rollback the installation, a rollback simply means removing the new driver and going back to the previous driver to get the device back working the way it previously was.

What does implicit deny mean? Implicit denial means that all traffic is denied unless it is specifically allowed by a rule.

What does explicit deny mean? Explicit denial allows all traffic unless it has been specially denied.
