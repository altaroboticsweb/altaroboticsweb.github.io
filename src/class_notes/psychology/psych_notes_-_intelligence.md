## History
Charles Spearman (1863-1945) believed we have one general intelligence (often shortened to g)

- That this is the heart of all our intelligent behavior, from navigating the sea to excelling in school
- He granted that people often have special, outstanding abilities
- But he noted that those who score high in one area such as verbal intelligence, typically score higher than acreage in other areas, such as spatial or reasoning ability

### Crystallized vs Fluid:

- ##### Crystallized:
	- Our accumulated knowledge and verbal skills; tends to increase with age
	- Cooking, working with computers, and writing

- ##### Fluid intelligence
	- Our ability to reason speedily and abstractly; tends to decrease with age; especially during late adulthood
	- Yoyoing, specific programming language, video games, and escape rooms


## Multiple intelligence's:
- Howard Gardner has identified eight relatively independent intelligence's, including the verbal and mathematical aptitudes assessed by standardized tests
    
- Musical, Body Kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Verbal Linguistic, Logical Mathematical, Naturalistic, Intrapersonal, and visual/spacial
    
- Thus, the computer programmer, the poet the street-smart adolescent, and the basketball team’s play-making point guard exhibit different kinds of intelligence
    
- Gardner has also proposed a ninth possible intelligence-existential intelligence-the ability “to ponder large questions about life”


#### Savant Syndrome
- A condition in which a person otherwise limited in mental inability has an exceptional specific skill, such as in computation or drawing
    

### Extreme Intelligence's

- #### Low extreme
	- Intellectual Disability: A condition of limited mental ability
	
	- Mental Age: A measure of intelligence test performance typically associated with children of a certain chronological age
	
	- Thus a child who does well as an average 8 year old is said to have the mental age of an 8 year old

- #### High extreme
	- Gifted and Talented
