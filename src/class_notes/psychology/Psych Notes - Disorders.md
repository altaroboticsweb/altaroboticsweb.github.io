## Understanding Disorders

### Babylon:

### Hebrews:
Ancient Hebrews saw psychological disorders as punishment for sin, and they too, looked to religion for a cure.

### Ancient Greek:
Socrates and other ancient Greek Philosophers blamed faulty thought processes for psychological disorders and believed in healing in the power of words.

### Early Attempts:
Early brain surgeries would cut part of the skull and remove parts that seemed to be infected, this did not work as the brain is necessary

Unfortunately, not all approaches to treatment have been humane

Fifteenth-century Europeans suspected that people showing symptoms of psychological disorders were possessed by demons, and they often tortured or executed the sufferers to oust these bad spirits

### Salem Witch Trials:
People with disorders in this town would be killed rather than considered for treatment, sparking the idea to find new ways to “fix” disordered people

### Philippe Pinel:
Late 1700s - early 1800s, these many wars caused that around 60% of the french population had mental disorders, so he created the medical model:

The medical model of mental illness is a concept that mental diseases have physical causes that can be diagnosed, treated, and in most cases cured

This model replaces the ugliness of asylums and torture with the humanness of hospitals and therapy

This medical model is still alive today, and focuses almost exclusively on nature and almost never on nuture, but it fails to be able to be used for disorders that cannot be physically detected
