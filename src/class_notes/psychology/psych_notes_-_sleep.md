### What are dreams:

The experiences you have when you hallucinate in stage 4 sleep; A sequence of images, emotions, and thoughts, passing through a sleeping person’s mind

#### Why do we dream:
- To store memories
    
- To develop and preserve neural pathways
    
- To makes sense of neural static
    
- To satisfy our own wishes
    
- Manifest content: The symbolic, remembered story line of a dream
    
- Latent content: The underlying meaning of a dream
#### Lucid dreams:
Lucid dreams are when you know that you’re dreaming while you’re asleep. You’re aware that the events flashing through your brain aren't really happening. But that dream feels vivid and real. You may even be able to control how the action unfolds, as if you’re directing a movie in your sleep.
