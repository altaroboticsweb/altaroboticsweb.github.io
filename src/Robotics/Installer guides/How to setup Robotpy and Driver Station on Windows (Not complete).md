Since you are on a windows machine you will run the win-robotpy-installer.py


### Robotpy Install
To install robotpy, you need to first make sure that you have a python**3.12** version, to download that, you can either look it up on Microsoft store or

Enter this [URL](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3.exe) into your search bar:
`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3.exe

This will automatically install the python3.12.3 installer, you will need to run this executable so that your system will register python3 commands

Open Command Prompt terminal or your VSCode project terminal

Enter this command into the terminal:
```Terminal
python3 -m pip install robotpy
python3 -m pip install robotpy-commands-v2
python3 -m pip install robotpy[phoenix5]
python3 -m pip install robotpy["commands2","phoenix5"]
