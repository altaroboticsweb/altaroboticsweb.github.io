# Required Parts
## robot.py
### Use:
The main program that will be run on the actual robot when the code is deployed to it, can be used to run robotContainer.py which has most of the infrastructure
### Path:
Main repository
### Connections:
#### Imports:
- commands2[^1]
- robotContainer.py[^2]
#### Deports to:
- NONE

## robotContainer.py
### Use:
Holds most of the robot's input commands, this is where you should put your controller commands to make the robot do stuff
### Path:
Main repository
### Connections:
#### Imports:
- wpilib[^1]
- constants[^2]
- subsystems[^2]
- commands[^2]
#### Deports:
- NONE

## constants.py
### Use:
Holds all the constants that are needed for the robot to follow, 
### Path:
Main repository

### Connections:
#### Imports:
- NONE
#### Deports:
- robotContainer.py[^2]
- subsystems:[^2]
	- aprilTagSubsystem.py
	- driveSubsystem.py

## Subsystems folder
### Use:
For the different components that are being controlled by the robot, such as the driving motors being one subsystem, vision being another, and manipulators (arms/hands) being another
### Path:
Main repository

## Commands folder
### Use:
Will hold your commands for the robot that will be used to control how the robot acts, most commands are only linked with one button that controls the robot to do a single thing such as rotate robot arm or interact with apriltags
### Path:
Main repository

## Utilities folder
### Use:
For storing functions that will be used by subsystems to interact with other files (I think?), e.g. aprilTagSubsystem will use a utils file to interact with the driverSubsystem to drive it towards an apriltag
### Path:
Main Repository

# Additional Parts (not included)
## dance.py
### Use:
While the button input is being held, it will run on a timer to move forward and backward on a steady beat
### Path:
Main repository / commands

## sneke.py
### Use:
While the button input is being held, it will run on a timer to move forward while turning left and right like a snake
### Path:
Main repository / commands

## forward.py
### Use:
Will move the robot straight forward as long as the button input is being held
### Path:
Main repository / commands


## Footnotes
